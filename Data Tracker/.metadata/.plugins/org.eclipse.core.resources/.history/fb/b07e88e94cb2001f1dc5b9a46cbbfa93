/**
 * Main class, this is the start of all the code.
 * CODE INSTRUCTION:
 * I have instructions on including an extra that is needed in the comments for View.display_graph().
 * 
 * Deviation from plan:
 * Initially I was thinking of making a database to store data points and I also said in a recitation submission
 * that I would make a GUI. But I later realized both of those options were not great, because I realized for submission purposes
 * I would need to figure out a way for the grader to also have access to the Database so I would need to host the database or something
 * that I felt was too complicated and time consuming.
 * For the GUI idea I realized a lot of my existing code in the mid-semester project submission was for the command line user interface
 * I had already made an extensive User Interface and I would need to delete all of it and kind of start from project from scratch to make
 * a GUI. Since I thought the existing command line UI was pretty good I wanted to continue with it. I also organised my UI code nicely
 * 
 * It is already a whole applications, ideas I had like db and GUI don't work Im seeing now, DB too complicated to host or figure out how to give access to prof to use and for 
 * GUI: I did a lot of work on console UI for midsemester, I would have to delete all of it for to make a GUI. Its already good type.
