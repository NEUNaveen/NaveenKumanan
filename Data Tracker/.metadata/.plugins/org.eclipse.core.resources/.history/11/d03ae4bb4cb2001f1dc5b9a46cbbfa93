/**
 * Main class, this is the start of all the code.
 * CODE INSTRUCTION:
 * I have instructions on including an extra that is needed in the comments for View.display_graph().
 * 
 * Deviation from plan:
 * Initially I was thinking of making a database to store datapoints and I also said in a recitation submission
 * that I would make a GUI. Bt 
 * 
 * It is already a whole applications, ideas I had like db and GUI don't work Im seeing now, DB too complicated to host or figure out how to give access to prof to use and for 
 * GUI: I did a lot of work on console UI for midsemester, I would have to delete all of it for to make a GUI. Its already good type.
