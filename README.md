## Knights Tour Algorithm Visualisation
- Final project for my Algorithms class I took in Fall 2024
- 3 person Group Project
- Runs and shows a visualization of the knights tour algorithm with inputed board size.
- The alogorithm is very slow so it will take close to 10 minutes to run a 9*10 board. Smaller valid boards will work quickly.

## Data Tracker
